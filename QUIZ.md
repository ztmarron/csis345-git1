1. Explain how git enables saving code.

Git enables saving code by allowing its users to group code changes into "commits". These commits display the history of the code and allow for its evolution over time to be observed and analyzed. Additionally, git allows users to navigate through previous commits/snapshots of the code and make changes or revert sections of code, as needed.

2. Explain how git enables tracking code.

Git enables tracking code by allowing its users to create and manipulate branchs of commits within a repository -- these branches are independent and allow multiple versions of the code (based on a common history) to be modified simultaneously without affecting the other branches or causing conflicts. Changes between these branches can be merged back together partially or entirely, as needed. The cumulative effect of this functionality is that complex and interdependent modifications can be performed and tracked with very little overhead, and git offers powerful tools for resolving merge conflicts and tracking the relative positions of the various branches that might exist in a repository at a given time.
